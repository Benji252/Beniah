                <p>There are over 1 billion bicycles currently being used all around the world. Cycling as a popular
                    pastime and competitive sport was established during late 19th century in England. Bicycles save
                    over 238 million gallons of gas every year. Smallest bicycle ever made has wheels of the size of
                    silver dollars.</p>

                <h2>Biking Facts </h2>

                <p>In 1817, Karl von Drais, a German baron, invented a horseless carriage that would help him get around
                    faster. The two-wheeled, pedal-less device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground.
                    The machine became known as the “draisine,” and led to the creation of the modern-day bicycle.</p>
